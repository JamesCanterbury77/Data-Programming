Password Tester - https://www.projectpro.io/article/cybersecurity-machine-learning-projects/631

This is one of the unique machine learning projects in cybersecurity.
For this project, you can create a cyber security project to evaluate the strength
of your credentials per the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) guidelines.
Use datasets of weak passwords, previously leaked passwords, etc., as input for the system
and apply various machine learning algorithms to train your application. When the current user
enters any similar passwords, the system alerts them. While still allowing for user flexibility,
the application should impose fundamental rules like minimum password length and complexity, avoiding
usernames or publicly available information, using numeric and special characters, and other rules.
To make things easier for users, the system might promote the usage of passphrases rather than
specific passwords. Only when all test scenarios are successful should password strength testers
mark a password as strong.

Scrape 10,000 most common passwords

PasswordStats.strength(weak_bits=30)
Get password strength as a number normalized to range {0 .. 1}.

Normalization is done in the following fashion:

If entropy_bits <= weak_bits -- linear in range{0.0 .. 0.33} (weak)
If entropy_bits <= weak_bits*2 -- almost linear in range{0.33 .. 0.66} (medium)
If entropy_bits > weak_bits*3 -- asymptotic towards 1.0 (strong)
